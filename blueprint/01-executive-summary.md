# Executive Summary and Project Context
## Background
[WE BUILD](https://webuildconsortium.eu/) is a [Large Scale Pilot (LSP)](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/spaces/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/pages/694487808/What+are+the+Large+Scale+Pilot+Projects) funded by the European Commission. The project tests how the European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet and the European Business Wallet (EBW) can support cross-border business processes across the EU.

The goal is practical: reduce administrative barriers that slow down companies when they operate across borders, such as opening a bank account, exchanging trusted business documents, or registering a branch in another country.

WE BUILD is organised around 13 concrete use cases that demonstrate how digital identity wallets can support real business processes. These use cases are grouped into three main areas:

- Business (WP2) – processes such as company registration, mandates and representation.
- Supply Chain (WP2) – logistics, transport documentation and electronic invoicing.
- Payments & Banking (WP3) – secure payments and simplified onboarding to financial services.

## WE BUILD’s Role in the EUDI and EBW Journey
WE BUILD operates within the emerging EUDI and EBW ecosystem, but it is not the final production environment. Instead, the project acts as a large-scale pilot where technical solutions, governance models and interoperability rules can be tested through real use cases.

In the final EUDI ecosystem, every EU citizen will receive an EUDI Wallet at Level of Assurance (LoA) High.

WE BUILD focuses in particular on the EBW, designed for economic operators to manage mandates, exchange trusted business documents such as electronic invoices, and receive legally valid notifications. Some EBW functions, such as onboarding and data portability, will operate at LoA Substantial.

### Bridging ARF Gaps through Specifications and Testing

The future EUDI ecosystem is defined through the [Architecture Reference Framework (ARF)](https://eudi.dev/latest/architecture-and-reference-framework-main/). Because the ARF is still evolving, it does not yet cover every implementation detail. In the WE BUILD pilot environment, the full certification and qualification schemes used in production cannot always be applied.

To address these gaps, WE BUILD defines project-specific implementation rules through: 
- [WE BUILD Conformance Specifications (WBCS)](https://github.com/webuild-consortium/wp4-architecture/tree/main/conformance-specs) – technical rules that implementations must follow.
- [Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)](https://github.com/webuild-consortium/wp4-architecture/tree/main/adr) – documented architecture decisions that guide the project.

In the final ecosystem, wallets and services must undergo formal certification by national supervisory bodies. 

| WE BUILD does not | WE BUILD does |
|---------------|----------------|
| certify EUDI wallets | provide WE BUILD wallets that pass ITB testing |
| rely on eIDAS-eID | provide WE BUILD eID with fictitious but realistic identities |
| create eIDAS-qualified e-signatures | define WE BUILD qualification of e-signatures focused on technical interoperability |
| use real MS registries | use real public sector bodies where possible, otherwise simulate them using fictitious |
| use the EC List of Trusted Lists (LoTL) | provide a WE BUILD LoTL |
| use the MS Trusted lists (TL) | provide WE BUILD TLs with input from supervisory bodies where available |
| reach production-level legal liability | operate within the WE BUILD agreement and trust framework, not within eIDAS |
| deal with national policy-making | use the WP5 MS Forum to indicate alignment with national policy-making |
| deal with universal definitions | define WE BUILD semantics within the available timeframe |
| issue EUDIW-RP access certificates | issue WE BUILD RP access certificates |
| issue eIDAS-QEAA | define WE BUILD QEAA focused on technical interoperability |

## Work Package 4 (WP4) - General Capabilities
The technical groups in WP4 - Architecture, Semantics, Wallet Providers, PID & EBWOID Providers, Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP), Trust Registry Infrastructure, and Test Infrastructure - provide the technical capabilities that support the use cases. 

WP2 and WP3 use cases are expected to use the capabilities provided by WP4 rather than developing parallel technical solutions.

To ensure interoperability across participants, WE BUILD uses three levels of documentation:

1. This **Architecture & Integration Blueprint (D4.1)** - the high-level architecture and system overview.
2. [**Architectural Decision Records (ADR)**](https://github.com/webuild-consortium/wp4-architecture/tree/main/adr) - explains major architecture decisions and the reasoning behind them.
3. [**WE BUILD Conformance Specifications (WBCS)**](https://github.com/webuild-consortium/wp4-architecture/tree/main/conformance-specs) – defines the detailed technical requirements that implementations must follow.

The governance process behind ADRs and WBCS, including how decisions are proposed and adopted, is described in Chapter 7.

The Interoperability Testbed (ITB) is a first step toward understanding conformity assessment requirements. In a controlled consortium environment, regulatory and technical specifications are translated into executable interoperability scenarios.

## Getting Started
The Blueprint is the starting point for understanding how WE BUILD works.

- Technical teams should begin with the WBCS to implement their interfaces.
- Architects should review the ADRs to understand the key architecture decisions.
- Every implementation must pass through the [Interoperability Testbed (ITB)](https://github.com/webuild-consortium/wp4-interop-test-bed) before participating in pilots.
