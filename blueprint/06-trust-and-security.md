# Trust, Security and Governance

The previous chapter described the structure of the information stored in wallets and exchanged as attestations. This chapter describes the trust infrastructure that allows ecosystem participants to validate those attestations.

## Trust Ecosystem

The trust infrastructure for the EUDI and EBW ecosystem is based on three complementary processes: **registration/onboarding** of participants, **notification** of certain entities to the European Commission, and **publication of Trusted Lists** (or Lists of Trusted Entities) that provide cryptographic trust anchors for validation. 

## Establishing Trust Between Participants

WE BUILD defines the onboarding processes (how entities get registered), the trust framework (which rules apply), the PKI architecture (which certificates are used and how), the APIs used to query trust information programmatically, and the trust evaluation logic used by participants at runtime.

The infrastructure is based on the Trusted List model defined in the eIDAS Regulation and the ARF. It follows the European model in which a List of Trusted Lists (LoTL) points to Trusted Lists. Each Trusted List contains entries for authorised participants such as PID Providers, Attestation Providers (QEAA, PuB-EAA, non-qualified EAA), Wallet Providers, and Relying Parties.

The onboarding processes define how participants join the ecosystem. This includes how:
- **Relying Parties** register, accept policies and configure access controls
- **PID and Attestation Providers** register, declare supported attestation types and obtain registration and access certificates
- **Wallet Providers** register and issue wallet instance attestations
- **Trust Service Providers** register and publish relevant certificates

Once onboarding is completed, participants use the trust infrastructure to evaluate each other during normal operation. WE BUILD therefore defines a set of trust evaluation scenarios covering how participants verify each other at runtime.

These scenarios include: 
- a Wallet Unit evaluating a Credential Issuer before requesting a PID or attestation
- a Credential Issuer evaluating the Wallet Unit before issuing
- a Wallet Unit evaluating a Relying Party before presenting attributes
- a Relying Party evaluating presented credentials (PID, QEAA, PuB-EAA, non-qualified EAA)
- discovery and consumption of the LoTL and TLs.

For detailed information on authorities, registries and responsibilities, see [Appendix C - Trust Ecosystem](#appendix-c-trust-ecosystem).

### Trust infrastructure architecture (overview)

In the [Appendix - Trust Ecosystem](../appendix-trust-ecosystem.md) there is a diagram that summarises the roles of Member State and European Commission, the split between registration and notification, and how Trusted Lists and the LoTL are produced and consumed. A simplified version used in WE BUILD is shown below.

## Revocation Scenarios 
The following scenarios align with and extend the revocation baseline defined in the [EUDI Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF)](https://eudi.dev/). EBWOID revocation follows the same principles as PID revocation where applicable for the European Business Wallet; any additional provisions are as defined in the EBW proposal and related ARF updates.

It is necessary to identify and categorize all potential situations that necessitate the invalidation of a PID, an EBWOID, or a Wallet. The resulting framework should address a wide range of real-world events, from user-initiated requests to administrative actions and security incidents.

* **Explicit User Request:** A direct request from the holder or an authorised representative to revoke the relevant data.
     
* **Data Inaccuracy or Modification:** Revocation initiated by the provider when the holder's underlying data is found to be inaccurate or has been officially modified.
   * _Example: The holder changes their name and the PID needs to be reissued._
     
* **Regulatory Changes:** Revocation required by regulatory changes that result in an incompatible PID/EBWOID, such as a required attribute being added, removed or renamed.
   * _Example:  A new obligatory attribute is introduced in the EBWOID following a new regulation._
     
* **Loss, Theft, or Compromise:** Notification that the holder's credentials or authentication device have been lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised.
     
* **Provider Revocation:** Revocation of wallet unit certificate (e.g. as a result of Wallet Provider compromise) or PID/LPID Provider certificate.
   * _Example: A Wallet Provider fails to meet mandatory security compliance standards, resulting in the withdrawal of its authorization to operate in the eIDAS Trust Framework and is thus not allowed to provide wallet solutions anymore._
     
* **Abusive or Fraudulent Use:** Detection of abusive, fraudulent, or unauthorised activities associated with the identity data.
   * _Example 1: An economic operator observes that the business wallet is used for unauthorised transactions by representatives of the company._
   * _Example 2: A law enforcement agency asks the PID provider by court order for revocation of a criminal user's PID._
     
* **Prolonged Inactivity:** Revoking/Cancelling of reissuance due to extended periods of non-use, as defined by the provider's policy.
   * _Example: A new PID is issued to replace an expiring one, but the holder fails to actively accept or "pick up" the new credential within the allowed grace period, leading the provider to revoke/cancel the unclaimed PID to prevent it from remaining in a pending state._
     
* **Violation of Service Terms:** A breach of contractual obligations, service terms of use, or other applicable regulations by the holder.
   * _Example: The EBWOID Issuer's terms of service specify an annual fee for issued attestations which the business fails to pay._
     
* **End-of-life Revocation Events:** End of life lifecycle events for natural respectively legal persons.
  * _Example PID: Death of holder_
  * _Example EBWOID: Termination of the legal entity/business activity, such as liquidation of a company._

### Technical realisation

Revocation of PID or attestation data itself is implemented by issuers through issuer-specific mechanisms (e.g. revocation lists). **Revocation or withdrawal of providers or services** is reflected in the trust infrastructure as follows: (1) status changes in **Trusted Lists / Lists of Trusted Entities** (e.g. service status values, withdrawn or suspended), and (2) where applicable, invalidation of access or unit certificates. Wallet Units and Relying Parties SHALL evaluate Trusted Lists and registry information per the referenced ETSI procedures and ARF trust-evaluation requirements (e.g. ISSU_24, ISSU_24a, ISSU_34a, RPA_04, RPRC_16, RPRC_21) so that revoked or withdrawn providers and services are not trusted. Formats and procedures are specified in the WP4 Trust Group trust-infrastructure schema and ETSI trusted lists implementation profile.

### Provider Obligations
To maintain a trusted ecosystem, PID and EBWOID providers agree to:
  * Publish clear policies stating when and how data is revoked.
  * Own the Authority: only the original issuer can materially revoke the data it issued.
  * Notify holders promptly: if data is revoked, the holder must be informed of the reason within 24 hours via a secure channel.
  * Be Irreversible: Once identity data is revoked, it stays revoked to prevent fraud.

### Conditions for Mandatory Revocation
According to the rules, a provider must revoke without delay if:
 * The holder explicitly requests it.
 * The security of the wallet app itself (the unit certificate) is compromised.
 * Any of the specific situations defined in the provider's public policy occur.
