# How the Wallet Interacts with Services
Todo:
 - EBW: the issuing we do
 - This chapter describes the general **WE BUILD PID/EBWOID issuing process** in a sequence diagram.
 - Mention ETSI standardization: ETSI TS 119 472-3 for (Q)EAA and PID issuance. ETSI TS 119 476-3 will standardize WUA and WIA.
 - High-Level Flows - Revocation and status checking
 - PID issuing

## Interaction Pattern: Attestation Issuance
To be authored by Group 6 (QTSP) and Group 7 (Wallets). Focuses on how use cases get data into the wallet (e.g., PID or QEAA) using protocols like OpenID4VCI (but no need to mention that part, stuff like that should be mainly in CS). 

The [WE BUILD Consortium Conformance Specification (CS)](https://github.com/webuild-consortium/wp4-architecture/blob/blueprint/updates-jan/conformance-specs/cs-01-credential-issuance.md) for high-assurance credential issuance defines the requirements that will be applied within the WE BUILD project to ensure that Wallet Units and Credential Issuers across the WE BUILD ecosystem interoperate reliably and consistently when issuing verifiable digital credentials, with strong security guarantees and privacy protections.

The WE BUILD ecosystem mainly supports two credential issuance models, which differ in which actor inititates the process: wallet-initiated issuance and issuer-initiated-issuance In both cases, if the credential cannot be issued immediately, a deferred issuance mechanism is applied. In such case, the wallet will automatically make periodic retries until the credential is successfully issued or until it receives an unrecoverable error.

### Wallet-initiated issuance

This issuance flow is initiated by the wallet user:

1. The user opens their wallet and selects the credential type to be issued (for example, a PID or a QEAA).
2. The wallet connects with the corresponding issuer and requests the credential.
3. The wallet user authenticates with the issuer, following the procedure specified by the issuer itself.
4. The issuer requests the user's consent from the user to issue the credential and send it to their wallet.
5. The issuer generates the credential and delivers it to the wallet.
6. The wallet verifies the authenticity of the credential and stores it. From this point, the wallet user becomes responsible for managing the issued credential.

### Issuer-initiated issuance

This issuance flow is initiated by the issuer:

1. The user interacts with the issuer (for example, during a digital onboarding process).
2. The issuer prepares one or more credentials.
3. The issuer offers these credentials to the wallet user. This can be done in several ways, both same-device and cross-device:
- By displaying a QR code that the user shall scan with their wallet.
- By sending a link to the wallet.
4. The wallet displays the offer and requess confirmation from the user.
5. The wallet user authenticates with the issuer, following the procedure specified by the issuer itself.
6. The issuer requests the user's consent from the user to issue the credential and send it to their wallet.
7. The issuer generates the credential and delivers it to the wallet.
8. The wallet verifies the authenticity of the credential and stores it. From this point, the wallet user becomes responsible for managing the issued credential.

## Interaction Pattern: Attestation Presentation (Receiving) 

The [WE BUILD Conformance Specification for Credential Presentation](https://github.com/webuild-consortium/wp4-architecture/blob/blueprint/updates-jan/conformance-specs/cs-02-credential-presentation.md) describes how Wallet Units (WU) and Verifiers interoperate within the WE BUILD ecosystem. It covers presentation (request and response flows), interfaces between wallets and verifiers as well as security, privacy and interoperability requirements and same‑device and cross‑device invocation patterns

## Signature and Seal Integration
WE BUILD supports both wallet-centric and QTSP-operated approaches for electronic signatures and seals. In both models the wallet provides the user interaction layer, while cryptographic operations may take place either locally or in remote infrastructure operated by a Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP).

Both approaches are compatible with the architectural patterns described in the ARF. However, during the WE BUILD pilot phase not every wallet provider or QTSP is expected to implement every possible model. For interoperability across the consortium, WE BUILD therefore treats remote signing and sealing through QTSP-managed services with standardized interfaces as the common baseline. This reflects the current pilot scoping, which focuses on remote transaction flows. Local signing models may still be supported by individual wallet implementations, but they are not assumed as a uniform baseline for interoperability within the project.

This section aligns with the WP4 interoperability baselines defined for issuance and presentation flows. Proximity-based signing scenarios are currently outside the baseline protocol scope of the WE BUILD pilots.

### Wallet-centric Signing Model
In the wallet-centric model, the EUDI Wallet is the central component of the electronic signature process. Three distinct signing processes are considered, depending on where the Signature Creation Application (SCA) runs and where the Signature Creation Device (SCD) is hosted. 

#### Remote Signing with External SCA
The user initiates signing from the wallet, while the SCA is external. The document is sent to the external SCA for review and consent, after which the signing request is forwarded to a remote Signature Creation Device (SCD) that creates the signature and returns the result.

#### Remote Signing with Local SCA (Wallet as SCA)
The user initiates signing from the wallet, which also acts as the SCA. The document is presented to the user within the wallet for review and consent. After approval, the wallet forwards the signing request to a remote SCD that produces the signature and returns the result.

#### Local Signing
The user initiates signing from the wallet, which also acts as the Signature Creation Application (SCA). The document is presented to the user within the wallet for review and consent. After approval, the signature is created locally using a SCD integrated in the user’s device.

### QTSP-centric Signing and Sealing Model
In the QTSP-centric model, the trust service provider operates the signing or sealing process. The cryptographic key material used for signature or seal creation is generated, stored, and used within infrastructure controlled by or on behalf of the QTSP, typically in secure hardware environments. From the perspective of the user, signing and sealing are therefore remote operations. External components interact with the trust service through defined service interfaces, while the cryptographic operation itself is performed within the QTSP-controlled environment.

Within this architecture, the EUDI Wallet may act as a client-side orchestration component. It can authenticate the user, capture user intent, and trigger a signing operation. However, it does not operate the signature creation environment, does not manage signing credentials, and does not assume the regulatory responsibilities of a trust service provider.

In this model, the QTSP remains responsible for identity binding, credential issuance, and compliance with applicable ETSI standards. Signature or seal creation data remains under controlled conditions consistent with the required assurance level, and activation mechanisms enforce the conditions required for advanced or qualified signatures, including sole control where applicable.

In the WE BUILD pilot and ITB environment, eIDAS-qualified status cannot be achieved because the ITB operates outside the formal eIDAS certification and trust framework. Any reference to “qualified” in WE BUILD therefore represents a technical demonstration only and does not constitute a legally valid qualified electronic signature. The prerequisites for eIDAS-qualified status remain unchanged, including use of a Qualified Signature Creation Device (QSCD) and a qualified certificate issued by a QTSP that is listed on an official national Trusted List.

The pilot implementation aims to remain technically aligned with qualified signing requirements. Pilot trust validation is described below and relies on consortium trusted lists referenced in ADRs and based on ETSI TS 119 612.

### CSC Interoperability Profile for Remote Signing and Sealing
For remote signing and sealing flows, WE BUILD uses the Cloud Signature Consortium (CSC) interoperability framework. Remote signing/sealing services expose standardized interfaces based on CSC API, allowing wallets and client applications to interact with QTSP-operated signing services in a consistent way.

The detailed WE BUILD CSC interoperability profile will be defined in a WBCS. That specification will describe the concrete integration details, including authorization mechanisms, endpoints, supported formats and algorithms, and interoperability constraints used in the ITB. Until such a profile is published, CSC API v2.2.0.0 serves as the base reference specification for CSC-based interactions.

During the pilot phase, trust validation relies on consortium reference trust mechanisms. Wallet components or external SCAs validate participating QTSPs and trust anchors using WE BUILD trusted lists. The reference trusted list may include participating QTSP entries and their registered issuing certificate authorities for pilot purposes.

When a signing request is processed, the SCA validates the signer’s certificate chain against issuing certificate authorities listed in the WE BUILD trusted list and checks the QTSP status within the pilot trust framework. Revocation status is validated using OCSP responders or CRL distribution points operated by participating QTSPs. Where registration status checks are required, registrar processes are simulated through mock registrar services and endpoints.

Because the WE BUILD environment operates as a pilot testbed, any “qualified” status is simulated for technical testing purposes only and has no legal effect. Where required, additional attributes or roles may be validated using relevant attestations, such as organisational affiliation or professional credentials.

### Organisational Signing: Individuals Signing on Behalf of a Company
WE BUILD supports signing scenarios where an individual signs on behalf of an organisation. This model reuses the wallet-centric and QTSP-operated signing approaches described above. The wallet provides the user interface for document review and approval, while the QTSP performs the signature or seal creation within its controlled environment. 

In these scenarios, the transaction must bind both the natural person and the organisation represented. The natural person identity is represented by the PID, while the organisation context is represented through the EBWOID, which acts as the cross-border minimum organisation identifier.

At signing time, identifiers or references to both the PID and the EBWOID are included in the transaction data presented to the user and subsequently authorised or signed. This ensures that the resulting signature or seal can be unambiguously linked to both the individual and the organisation.

The exact representation of these bindings is use-case specific and will be defined in rulebooks and WBCS to ensure interoperability in the ITB.

## Secure communication channel
In WE BUILD, the secure communication channel will be implemented through Qualified Electronic Registered Delivery Services (QERDS) operated by QTSPs. The core idea will be that whenever a message will need legal-grade delivery assurance (who sent what, to whom, and when it was received), it will be routed through QERDS so that delivery will be registered and can later be proven to a relying party. The QERDS providers also ensure mutual authentication, end-to-end integrity and confidentiality, and interoperability across access points. This “registered delivery” pattern will be positioned as an enabler for interactions between and across public sector bodies and economic operators.

Whereas the QERDS and the EU Digital Directory designated for the production European Business Wallet are not yet ready, WE BUILD designates the pre-production QERDS specified by WP4 for use in WE BUILD business wallets.

### From “registered delivery” to “digital identity wallets”
As a baseline a classic B2G/B2B situation will be used: an authority will notify an economic operator, the economic operator will respond, and the relying party will require evidence. With QERDS, both sides will use their QERDS providers to register sending and receiving, so that delivery will not be just transport, but will be a process that will produce trustworthy evidence.

WE BUILD will take the next step: wallets will become the user-facing endpoints (“wallet-centric delivery”). The sender wallet and recipient wallet will remain the places where users will read, will approve, and will manage messages, or where they will configure connections to backend systems to perform these actions. QERDS providers will form the delivery layer underneath, handling routing, inter-provider exchange, and evidence creation, while wallets will provide identity/authentication and user control.

### Technical flow (WE BUILD high-level)
WE BUILD will follow the QERDS architecture decomposition and the 4-corner delivery pattern:
1) Sender identification and authentication will be performed at the sender’s QTSP (wallet-driven).
2) Message submission will be performed from the sender’s wallet or connected backend system to the sender QERDS (QTSP A).
3) Discovery of the recipient’s QERDS endpoint and capabilities will be performed via common services (e.g., the WE BUILD Digital Directory, simulating the EU Digital Directory from the European Business Wallet proposal).
4) Handshake and relay will be performed between QTSP A and QTSP B (QERDS-to-QERDS interoperability) and will be based on ETSI EN 319 522.
5) Recipient notification will be issued, followed by recipient authentication being performed at QTSP B.
6) Consignment and handover of the message and its metadata will be performed to the recipient’s wallet or connected backend system.
7) Evidence will be made accessible to sender and recipient wallets (submission/dispatch and receipt/consignment or non-delivery). Evidence will be protected by qualified sealing and, where required, qualified timestamping. Where applicable, the evidence can be pushed to the sender’s and the recipient’s backend systems as well.

## Enterprise and System-to-System Wallet Interactions
Some WE BUILD scenarios involve interactions between backend systems rather than direct end-user actions. In these cases, wallet functionality may be integrated into enterprise platforms, APIs, or automated services.

This is particularly relevant for EBW scenarios such as supply chain credentials, Digital Product Passports, and automated B2B or B2G data exchange. In such cases, credential issuance and presentation may be initiated by backend systems while still following the interoperability patterns defined in this blueprint.

Although the interaction is system-driven, the same trust framework, credential formats, and verification mechanisms apply as in user-driven wallet interactions.
